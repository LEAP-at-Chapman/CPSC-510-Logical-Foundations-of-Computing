# Chapter 5: SMT Solving with Z3

*Author: Wayne*

## Introduction

This chapter explores SMT (Satisfiability Modulo Theories) solving using Microsoft's Z3 theorem prover. We extend beyond propositional logic to handle richer theories like arithmetic, arrays, and bit-vectors.

## Topics

- SMT theory foundations
- Z3 installation and setup
- Theory combination
- Program verification applications
- Model checking with SMT

## Resources

- [Z3 Documentation](https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3)
