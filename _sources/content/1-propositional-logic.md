# Propositional Logic

Author: Alexander Kurz

The purpose of this note is, on the one hand, to introduce the simplest logic that will appear in all other chapters. It is known as [propositional logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propositional_logic), or classical propositional logic (as opposed to variants such as [intuitionistic logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intuitionistic_logic)) or [Boolean logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_algebra) (to honor [George Boole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Boole) and as opposed to other algebraic logics.)

In class, we used mostly 

- Chapters 1.1, 1.3, 1.5, 1.6 in the [Open Logic Project](https://builds.openlogicproject.org/content/propositional-logic/propositional-logic.pdf) and
- Chapters 2 and 5 in the [Open Logic Project](https://builds.openlogicproject.org/content/propositional-logic/propositional-logic.pdf)

as our reference. Since this worked reasonably well we leave it at this for now.

The [Introduction to Logic](./0-logic.md) contains an overview and summary of the most important big ideas that we need.
