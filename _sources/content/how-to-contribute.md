# How to Contribute

Some suggested guidelines to consider when contributing to the book:

- Writing:
  - Inline clickable links that lead to further reading. If you look at https://leap-at-chapman.github.io/CPSC-510-Logical-Foundations-of-Computing/content/1-propositional-logic.html you see that I tried to make it easy for readers to access further information. You may find this tedious, but interesting inline links add a lot of value.
  - Avoid long code snippets that are uninterrupted by interesting explanations.
  - Link source code and other resources
- Organization and Layout:
  - Compare your table of contents with the one in compare your table of contents with the one suggested in https://leap-at-chapman.github.io/CPSC-510-Logical-Foundations-of-Computing/content/0-intro.html . Not all items will be equally meaningful for all topics, but it can be interesting to look for sth that is not immediately on the surface.
  - I turned on automatic numbering of sections and subsections. Make sure that this is compatible with the headings you choose for your subsections.
  - Do not have  only a single subsection in a section.
- References and Citations:
  - General Guideline: [How to Cite References](https://leap-at-chapman.github.io/CPSC-510-Logical-Foundations-of-Computing/content/how-to-cite.html#citations_).
  - Cite your references in the text. Do not list sth in the references if it is not cited.
  - There is no hard limit on the number of references. But it is important that the reader has a sense of why a particular reference is listed. 
  - For example, ask yourself: Why did you choose a particular reference and not another one? How does the chosen references relate to the rest of the chapter? What function do they accomplish? Do you list a reference as a recommendation for the reader to check out for themselves?  Does a reference serve the function of backing up with evidence some claim you made in the text? Etc.
