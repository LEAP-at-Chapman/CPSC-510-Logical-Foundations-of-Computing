# How to Cite References

This guide provides a simple format for citing sources in your chapter.

## TL;DR

**In text**: Use (Author(s), Year) or just (Author) if the year is obvious from context.  
**In References section**: Use the format `Author(s) (Year) [Title](link), Venue`

## Reference List Format

At the end of your chapter, create a **References** section with entries in this format:

```
Author(s) (Year) [Title](linkToGoogleScholarQuery), Venue
```

### Components

1. **Author(s)**: Last names only. For multiple authors:
   - 2 authors: `Davis and Putnam`
   - 3-4 authors: `Davis, Logemann, and Loveland`
   - 5+ authors: `Moskewicz et al.`

2. **Year**: Publication year in parentheses

3. **Title**: Full title as a clickable link (preferably to the paper, or to Google Scholar)

4. **Venue**: Journal name, conference proceedings, or publisher

### Citations

- **(Author, Year)**: Full citation when first mentioned or when multiple works by same author
  - "The DPLL algorithm (Davis, Logemann, and Loveland, 1962) is the basis for modern SAT solvers."
- **(Author)**: Short citation when the year is obvious or already mentioned
  - "Modern SAT solvers build on the work of (Davis and Putnam) and (Davis, Logemann, and Loveland)."
- **Author (Year)**: Narrative citation when the author is part of the sentence
  - "Davis and Putnam (1960) introduced a resolution-based algorithm."

### Multiple authors in text

- 2 authors: `(Davis and Putnam, 1960)` or `Davis and Putnam (1960)`
- 3+ authors: `(Moskewicz et al., 2001)` or `Moskewicz et al. (2001)`

### Multiple citations

Separate with semicolons: `(Davis and Putnam, 1960; Davis, Logemann, and Loveland, 1962)`
