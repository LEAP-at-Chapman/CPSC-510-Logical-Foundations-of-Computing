# Dependent Type Theory with Lean

*Author: Khoa Nguyen*

## Introduction

This chapter presents dependent type theory with Lean, demonstrating how types can depend on values and enabling "proofs as programs" through the Curry-Howard correspondence.

## Topics

- Dependent type theory foundations
- Lean installation and setup
- Type inference algorithms
- Proofs as programs paradigm
- Program verification with dependent types
