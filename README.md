# CPSC-510-Logical-Foundations-of-Computing

This is the repository for the course CPSC-510 Logical Foundations of Computing. 

At the end of the course, we will have written a draft of a [book](https://LEAP-at-chapman.github.io/CPSC-510-Logical-Foundations-of-Computing/intro.html) that teaches the logical foundations of computing starting from state of the art software tools.
