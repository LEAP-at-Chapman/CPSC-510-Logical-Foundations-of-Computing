# Change Log: 0-4-intro-modal-logic

## Overview
This chapter introduces modal logic, covering its relationship to propositional and first-order logic, possible worlds semantics, and its applications in temporal and epistemic logic. The chapter provides mathematical foundations and references to key texts.

## Reference Analysis

**Status**: [x] All references checked | [x] Issues found | [x] Fixed

### Issues Found

- Halpern and Vardi (1991): PDF link instead of Google Scholar, missing venue
- Blackburn, de Rijke, Venema (1995): Missing venue
- Kripke (1965): PDF link instead of Google Scholar, missing venue, incorrect year format
- All Kripke references: Duplicated in text (lines 56-58) and References section (lines 132-136)
- References section formatting: References had explanatory text mixed in, not in standard format

### Uncited References

- **Halpern and Vardi (1991)**: Appears in References section but is NOT cited in the chapter text. Should either be cited or removed.

### Changes Made

- Reformatted all 5 references to standard format: `Author(s) (Year) [Title](Google Scholar link), Venue`
- Changed Halpern and Vardi (1991) from PDF link to Google Scholar query, added venue (Artificial Intelligence)
- Changed Blackburn, de Rijke, Venema (1995) to include "and" for three authors, added venue (Cambridge University Press)
- Changed Kripke (1965) from PDF link to Google Scholar query, added venue (Zeitschr. f. math. Logik und Grundlagen d. Math.), fixed year format
- Standardized all Google Scholar query URLs
- Removed explanatory text from References section (moved to inline text where appropriate)
- Removed duplicate Kripke references from References section (kept the ones in the text at lines 56-58 which have more context)

- **Bridge to later chapters**: The chapter mentions temporal and epistemic logic but doesn't explicitly connect to the later chapters on these topics (Chapter 05 on Temporal Logic with Spin, Chapter 06 on Epistemic Logic with SMCDEL). Adding cross-references would help readers see the progression.
