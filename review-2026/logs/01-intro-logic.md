# Change Log: 01 - Short Intro to Logic

## Overview
This is a foundational introduction chapter that presents the big ideas of logic: validity, formal languages, decidability, satisfiability, duality of syntax and semantics, proof theory, model theory, soundness and completeness, and incompleteness. It serves as conceptual background for the rest of the book.

## Table of Contents Compliance

**Note**: This is a foundational/introductory chapter, not a tool-focused chapter, so it appropriately does not follow the typical chapter structure.

| Section | Present? | Notes/Reason if Missing |
|---------|----------|-------------------------|
| Idea | [X] Yes [ ] No | Covered conceptually through "Big Ideas of Logic" |
| Basic Theory | [X] Yes [ ] No | Each section (Validity, Formal Language, etc.) presents basic theory |
| Tool | [ ] Yes [X] No | Not applicable - this is a conceptual introduction, not a tool chapter |
| Introductory Examples | [X] Yes [ ] No | Includes examples (Socrates argument, Sudoku encoding) |
| The Landscape of Tools | [ ] Yes [X] No | Not applicable - foundational chapter |
| Algorithms | [ ] Yes [X] No | Not applicable - conceptual introduction |
| Typical Use Cases | [ ] Yes [X] No | Not applicable - foundational chapter |
| Benchmarks and Competitions | [ ] Yes [X] No | Not applicable - foundational chapter |
| Applications in Industry | [ ] Yes [X] No | Not applicable - foundational chapter |
| Case Study | [ ] Yes [X] No | Not applicable - foundational chapter |
| History | [ ] Yes [X] No | Mentions historical figures (Aristotle, Boole, Gödel) but no dedicated section |
| Formal Methods and AI | [ ] Yes [X] No | Has footnote about AI but no dedicated section |
| Current Developments | [ ] Yes [X] No | Not applicable - foundational chapter |
| References | [X] Yes [ ] No | Present |
| Future Work | [ ] Yes [X] No | Not applicable - foundational chapter |
| Contributors | [ ] Yes [X] No | Not present |

**Overall Assessment**: The chapter appropriately deviates from the suggested TOC because it serves a different purpose - it's a foundational introduction to concepts rather than a tool-focused chapter. The structure (conceptual sections on big ideas) is appropriate for its role. The only minor consideration is that some references use inline links rather than formal citations, but this is acceptable for an introductory chapter.
