## Table of Contents Compliance

**Note**: This is a very brief introductory note, not a full tool-focused chapter. It appropriately deviates from the typical chapter structure.

| Section | Present? | Notes/Reason if Missing |
|---------|----------|-------------------------|
| Idea | [X] Yes [ ] No | Implicitly covered - introduces propositional logic as the simplest logic |
| Basic Theory | [X] Yes [ ] No | Briefly covers formulas, valuations, satisfaction, satisfiability, tautology, natural deduction, tableaux |
| Tool | [ ] Yes [X] No | Not applicable - this is a conceptual introduction, not a tool chapter |
| Introductory Examples | [ ] Yes [X] No | Mentions examples but doesn't include them (references external textbook) |
| The Landscape of Tools | [ ] Yes [X] No | Not applicable - foundational note |
| Algorithms | [ ] Yes [X] No | Not applicable - foundational note |
| Typical Use Cases | [ ] Yes [X] No | Not applicable - foundational note |
| Benchmarks and Competitions | [ ] Yes [X] No | Not applicable - foundational note |
| Applications in Industry | [ ] Yes [X] No | Not applicable - foundational note |
| Case Study | [ ] Yes [X] No | Not applicable - foundational note |
| History | [ ] Yes [X] No | Not present - brief note doesn't include history |
| Formal Methods and AI | [ ] Yes [X] No | Not present - brief note |
| Current Developments | [ ] Yes [X] No | Not present - brief note |
| References | [X] Yes [ ] No | Present, but format doesn't follow citation guidelines |
| Future Work | [ ] Yes [X] No | Not applicable - brief note |
| Contributors | [ ] Yes [X] No | Author listed at top but no Contributors section |

**Overall Assessment**: This is appropriately structured as a brief introductory note rather than a full chapter. The deviations are justified because it serves as a quick reference/overview that points to external resources (Open Logic Project). However, the References section doesn't follow the citation format from `how-to-cite.md` - it's just listing links. For a brief note, this might be acceptable, but ideally it should follow the format: `Author(s) (Year) [Title](link), Venue`. Since this is a very short note and the Open Logic Project is more of a resource collection than a traditional publication, the current format is acceptable but could be improved.
