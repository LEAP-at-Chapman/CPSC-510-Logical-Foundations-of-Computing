| Idea | [X] Yes [ ] No | Present |
| Basic Theory | [X] Yes [ ] No | Present, includes Curry-Howard Correspondence |
| Tool | [X] Yes [ ] No | "Tool" section with installation instructions |
| Introductory Examples | [X] Yes [ ] No | "Introductory Examples" section with Logic Game and Natural Number Game |
| The Landscape of Tools | [X] Yes [ ] No | Present with comparison table |
| Algorithms | [X] Yes [ ] No | Present - covers bidirectional typing, equality checking, elaboration |
| Typical Use Cases | [ ] Yes [X] No | Not present as separate section, but covered in "Applications in Industry" |
| Benchmarks and Competitions | [X] Yes [ ] No | Present |
| Applications in Industry | [X] Yes [ ] No | Present |
| Case Study | [X] Yes [ ] No | Present - 3D Point Transformation Pipeline |
