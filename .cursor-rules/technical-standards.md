# Technical Standards for Review

## Complexity Claims

- Verify all complexity class assignments
- Check that decidable vs. undecidable distinctions are correct
- Ensure complexity bounds match the actual problems being solved

## Logic Coverage

- Verify that logics are correctly categorized (decidable/undecidable)
- Check that complexity classes match the logic fragments
- Ensure examples are appropriate for the complexity class

## Code Examples

- Ensure code examples are syntactically correct
- Verify that examples match the described behavior
- Check that file paths and references are correct
- Ensure installation instructions are accurate

## References

- Verify that links work
- Check that citations are properly formatted
- Ensure references are relevant and accurate
- Add missing key references where appropriate

## Mathematical Notation

- Ensure consistent notation throughout
- Verify that mathematical statements are correct
- Check that definitions match standard usage
- Ensure proofs (if present) are logically sound

## Tool Documentation

- Verify installation instructions
- Check that tool versions are specified
- Ensure examples work with current tool versions
- Update outdated information
