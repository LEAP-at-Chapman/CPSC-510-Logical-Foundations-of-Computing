Planning to put the reasoning script onto object-oriented rails.
It will take some time to accomplish, but will give some benefits...
E.g. to be able to easily add new results,
to be able to automatically show <i>all</i> results
that follow from the given ones,
to be able to add new complexity "measures" (such as
complexity of query answering, complexity of finite model reasoning, etc),
and even to
create other Complexity Navigators (say, for sub-boolean logics like <em>EL</em>,
or for modal logics, etc). So far, any of these tasks requires a lot of
manual work and re-programming many things.

In the (PSpace-complete) Description Logics <em>SIN</em> and <em>SIQ</em>&nbsp;,
it is assumed that transitive roles are <i>not</i>
used in number restrictions (although it is only said on p.24 of 
[<a target=_self href="index.html#HorrocksSattlerTobies1998_Anchor">HorrocksSattlerTobies1998</a>, Definition&nbsp;19]
and not mentioned in the abstract,
so I didn't mention it in the Navigator before; now it's fixed).

<p style="margin-top:1mm">

&bull; On the contrary, for the unrestricted
<em>SIN</em> and <em>SIQ</em>&nbsp;,
concept satisfiability w.r.t. general TBoxes is undecidable;
see [<a target=_self href="index.html#KazSatZolin2007_Anchor">KazSatZol2007</a>]
(note that no role hierarchy was needed to obtain undecidability).

<p style="margin-top:1mm">

&bull; In fact, the unrestricted 
<em>SIQ</em>&nbsp; is the <i>fusion</i>
of several copies of the
graded inverse modal logics:
<b>GrIK</b> (which is PSpace-complete)
and
<b>GrIK4</b> (which is (globally) undecidable).

<p style="margin-top:1mm">

&bull; At the same time, the restricted 
<em>SIQ</em>&nbsp; is the <i>fusion</i>
of several copies of the
inverse modal logics:
<b>GrIK</b> (which is PSpace-complete)
and
<b>IK4</b> (which is PSpace-complete);
that is why it is PSpace-complete.

<p style="margin-top:1mm">

&bull; Is concept satifiability (without TBoxes)
for the unrestricted <em>SIQ</em> undecidable too?
I.e. is the the unrestricted <em>SIQ</em> locally undecidable?
Yes! (the result will be published soon)

In a recent paper I read:
<cite>
The description logic <em>S</em> extends <em>ALC</em> with transitive roles,
and so can be thought of as the union of <b>K<sub>m</sub></b> and <b>K4<sub>m</sub></b>.</cite>
Nope, this is not fair...
As everyone knows, <b>K</b>&nbsp;&sub;&nbsp;<b>K4</b>, so their union is just <b>K4</b>.

<p style="margin-top:1mm">

&bull; In fact, <em>S</em> corresponds to the <i>fusion</i>
of several copies of the (PSpace-complete) modal logics <b>K</b> and <b>K4</b>.

<p style="margin-top:1mm">

&bull; Similarly, unrestricted <em>SQ</em>&nbsp;
(i.e., where transitive roles are allowed in number restrictions)
corresponds to the <i>fusion</i>
of several copies of
the graded modal logics:
<b>GrK</b> (which is PSpace-complete)
and <b>GrK4</b> (which is NExpTime-complete);
so concept satisfiability in the unrestricted <em>SQ</em> is decidable
(in fact, NExpTime-complete).

<p style="margin-top:1mm">
&bull; Furthermore, restricted <em>SQ</em>&nbsp;
(i.e., where transitive roles are <i>not</i> allowed in number restrictions)
corresponds to the <i>fusion</i>
of several copies of the
PSpace-complete graded modal logic 
<b>GrK</b>
and another PSpace-complete modal logic <b>K4</b>;
therefore, concept satisfiability in this logic is PSpace-complete.

<p style="margin-top:1mm">

&bull; Complexity of <b>GrK</b> and <b>GrK4</b>
can be found in [Kazakov, Pratt-Hartmann, 2009];
for the results on fusions of modal / description logics, see
[Frank Wolter, Fusion of Description Logics, JAIR, 2002].

A trivial, but missing, bunch of results is added:
All role constructors in the logic
<em>ALC</em>(&cup;,o,<i>id</i>) are eliminable.
Therefore, for all its sublogics the complexity of all problems
(concept satisfiablilty and ABox consistency,
with or without TBox) is the same as for <em>ALC</em>.
Similarly for <em>ALC</em> extended with inverse roles and/or nominals.

<td style="text-align:justify">
In <em>SHIQ</em> family of Description Logics, there is a notorious
restriction on the syntax: transitive roles and their sub-roles cannot
be used in number restrictions (otherwise, the logic becomes undecidable).
Our recent results [<a target=_self href="index.html#KazSatZolin2007_Anchor">KazSatZol2007</a>]
shows that, in many cases, one <i><b>can</b></i> use transitive roles in number restrictions &#150;
and still have a decidable logic!
So the notion of a <i>simple</i> role could be substantially extended.

ABox consistency in the logic <em>ALCI</em> with empty or acyclic TBoxes
is PSpace-complete, a result obtained in
[<a target=_self href="index.html#DingHaWiDL2007_Anchor">Ding et al., 2007</a>]
by reduction of logics with inverses to logics without inverses.

<td style="text-align:justify">Improved interface:
whether role complement is atomic or full, and
whether complex roles are allowed or forbidden in number restrictions

Otherwise people often forget about these options and come to wrong conclusions.

<td style="text-align:justify">Finite model property and tree model property
depend on what kind
of TBoxes are allowed. Some minor corrections to the Navigator are applied,
with almost no effect on currently displayed results (just because there are very few
<i>positive</i> results on FMP or TMP for logics,
in which TBoxes are <i>not</i> internalized,
and for which adding TBoxes breaks FMP or TMP).

<a target=_self href="index.html#LutzArecHorSat2004_Anchor">C.Lutz, C.Areces, I.Horrocks, and U.Sattler, 2002</a>),

Now the picture concerning &mu;-logics is (relatively) complete:
all logics between <em>&mu;ALC</em> and <em>&mu;ALCQIO</em>
are ExpTime-complete (even with numbers coded in binary),
except for logics above <em>&mu;ALCFIO</em> (which are undecidable).
The remaining open problem about <em>&mu;ALCQO</em>
has been solved in [<a target=_self href="index.html#BonattiLutzICALP06_Anchor">P.Bonatti, C.Lutz, A.Murano, and M.Y.Vardi, 2006</a>].

<td style="text-align:justify">
All logics between <em>ALCFIO</em> and <em>ALCQIO</em>(&cap;,&cup;,&not;)
with or without TBoxes are NExpTime-complete (with unary number encoding only)
for both concept satisfiability and ABox consistency problems.
If we consider only "safe" boolean combinations of roles,
then such an extension of any logic between <em>ALC</em> and <em>ALCQI</em> is PSpace-complete
without TBoxes, and ExpTime-complete with general TBoxes
(the case of acyclic TBoxes remains open).
