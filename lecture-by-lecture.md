# Lecture by Lecture

**L1.1:** Introduction. [Overview](overview.md)

**L1.2:** Propositional Logic. Chapters 1.1, 1.3, 1.5, 1.6 in the [Open Logic Project](https://builds.openlogicproject.org/content/propositional-logic/propositional-logic.pdf).

**L2.1:** Propositional Logic. Chapters 2 and 5 in the [Open Logic Project](https://builds.openlogicproject.org/content/propositional-logic/propositional-logic.pdf).

**L2.2:** Satsolving and [MiniSat](https://hackmd.io/@alexhkurz/BkZofOIcxl). 

**L3.1:** Satsolving continued.

**L3.2:** Logic Programming and [Prolog](https://github.com/LEAP-at-Chapman/Intro-to-Logic-Programming?tab=readme-ov-file). We went over the first 7 pages of [these slides](https://github.com/LEAP-at-Chapman/Intro-to-Logic-Programming/blob/main/slides/LP1-introduction-to-logic-programming.pdf). Homework: Install SWI-Prolog as described [here](https://github.com/LEAP-at-Chapman/Intro-to-Logic-Programming?tab=readme-ov-file). Do the [eight queen's exercise](https://github.com/LEAP-at-Chapman/Intro-to-Logic-Programming/blob/main/eight-queens.md).

**L4.1:** Logic Programming continued.

**L4.2:** [Constraint Programming and MiniZinc](https://hackmd.io/@alexhkurz/HkNBH-Kogg). 

**L5.1:** Continued from L4.2.

**L5.2:** [SMT Solving and Z3](https://leap-at-chapman.github.io/CPSC-510-Logical-Foundations-of-Computing/content/5-smt-solving.html)

**L6.1-7.1:** Introduction to Modal Logic. Syntax, Semantics. [Muddy Children](https://hackmd.io/@alexhkurz/ryD5Deg6gg).

**L7.2:** [Model Checking with Spin](https://github.com/LEAP-at-Chapman/Intro-to-Model-Checking-with-Spin)

**L8.1:** Model Checking the Needham-Schroeder protocol in Spin.

**L8.2:** [Epistemic logic](https://hackmd.io/@alexhkurz/H1YRqFCpxg) and [Model Checking](https://hackmd.io/@alexhkurz/rJ-dCMvQgl).

**L9.1:** Epistemic Logic and SMCDEL continued, [see the Exercises](https://hackmd.io/@alexhkurz/r1C3ZYrRlg).

**L9.2:** Hoare Logic in Dafny. I first gave an example of how to use an [AI-Agent](./literature/dafny-in-industry/prompts/literature-review.prompt.md) to help with a literature review. Then I gave an [introduction to Dafny](./notes/dafny.md). Finally, we looked in more detail at [Hoare logic](https://leap-at-chapman.github.io/CPSC-510-Logical-Foundations-of-Computing/content/appendix-hoare-logic.html).

**L10.2:** [An Introduction to Isabelle](https://leap-at-chapman.github.io/CPSC-510-Logical-Foundations-of-Computing/content/appendix-syllogistic-logics.html)

**L11.2:** An Introduction to Lean and Dependently Typed Programming. [The Lean Game Server](https://adam.math.hhu.de/). [Natural Deduction](https://hackmd.io/@alexhkurz/r1bYDpMybx).

This finishes the list of software tools. The rest of the semester we spent on improving the book, solving epistemic puzzles (for example the 100 prisoners and the light bulb) and on analysing [mutual exclusion with a model checker](https://github.com/LEAP-at-Chapman/Intro-to-Model-Checking-with-Spin).
