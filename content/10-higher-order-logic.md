## 10.1 Idea and Introduction {#sec0-10-1}
WIP

This chapter extends to higher-order logic in Isabelle/HOL, showing how to reason about functions as first-class objects and exploring the foundations of modern theorem proving.

Higher-order logic (HOL) extends the capabilities of first-order logic (FOL) by allowing quantifiers (such as $ \forall x $ and $ \exists x $) to range over functions and predicates, not just individual elements. In addition, functions can be passed as arguments to other functions, returned as results, and manipulated just like any other data type. This enables more expressive statements about the properties of functions and their relationships.

## 10.2 Basic Theory {#sec0-10-2}
WIP

basic setup - need to add much more but this is just basics/scaffolding

### 10.2.1 First Order Logic 
WIP
$ \forall x $ and $ \exists x$ where x is a variable/individual element

### 10.2.2 Higher Order Logic 
WIP
$ \forall f(x) $ and $ \exists f(x) $ where x is a function that takes x as an input


## 10.3 Tool (Installation, First Example, First Exercise) {#sec0-10-3}

### 10.3.1 Installation
WIP

Looks like isabelle is a program we can just download normally via exe/dmg etc instead of messing around with command line or using `apt/brew`

[Installation Link for Isabelle](https://isabelle.in.tum.de/)

probably have detailed walktrhough for windows, macos, and ubuntu with pictures etc all that with pictures and all that pretty stuff (remove if it results in the chapter being too long)
