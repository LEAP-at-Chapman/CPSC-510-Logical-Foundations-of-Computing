# Temporal Logic with Spin

## Idea

Temporal logic is a system of logic used to reason about time. A statement in temporal logic may have a truth value that changes over the course of time. It includes new qualifiers that relate to time, such as: `always`, `eventually`, `never`, `until`, `whenever` etc.

For example: I will `eventually` be hungry

This mode of logic can be very useful in concurrent systems where two threads must be made to `never` access the same reasource at the same time.
