# Temporal Logic with Spin

## Idea

Temporal logic is a system of logic used to reason about time. A statement in temporal logic may have a truth value that changes over the course of time. It includes new qualifiers that relate to time, such as: *always*, *eventually*, *never*, *until*, *whenever* etc.

For example: I will *eventually* be hungry

This mode of logic can be very useful in concurrent systems where two threads must be made to *never* access the same reasource at the same time. 

## Basic Theory

Temporal logic views the system as a path through time, or a timeline. It includes all basic logical operators: and, or, not and implies.

It includes several additional modal operators:
* Until
* Release
* Next
* Future
* Globally
* All
* Exists
