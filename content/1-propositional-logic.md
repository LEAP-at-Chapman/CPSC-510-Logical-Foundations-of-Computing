# Propositional Logic

Author: Alexander Kurz

The purpose of this note is, on the one hand, to introduce the simplest logic that will appear in all other chapters. It is known as [propositional logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propositional_logic), or classical propositional logic (as opposed to variants such as [intuitionistic logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intuitionistic_logic)) or [Boolean logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_algebra) (to honor [George Boole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Boole) and as opposed to )

## Idea

### Formal Languages

### Satisfiability

### Duality of Syntax and Semantics

### Proof Theory

### Model Theory

In class, we used mostly used [our class notes] as our reference. Here, we will only give an outline of what was covered with an emphasis on how the topics will relate to later chapters.

Remark on parsing: Strings are trees.
